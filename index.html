<h1>What is Toolkitty?</h1>
<p>Toolkitty is a <span class="purple">coordination app</span> for collectives, organisers and venues. You can organise events, share resources and spaces in a <span class="purple">collaborative calendar</span>.</p>
<br>
<h2>Who is Toolkitty for?</h2>
<p>Toolkitty's collaborative feature supports informal and formal groups to <span class="yellow">self-organise</span><sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1" aria-describedby="fn1">1</a></sup>. Toolkitty has been trialled with a wide range of users in the arts sector including festivals, music venues and artists' studios, as well as a mental health charity.
<br>Approaches to Toolkitty may depend on the users' needs. For example:
<ul>
  <li>A <span class="red">venue</span> can use the app to minimise booking admin with regular promoters and collaborators able to autonomously add there own events.</li>
  <li>A <span class="blue">music promoter's collective</span> can use the app to collectively organise gigs across a range of venues and to share the resources they need to run them.</li>
  <li>An <span class="purple">artist</span> can use the resource section of the app to list locations of found objects which can then be collected by others for use in a collaborative artwork.</li>
  <li>A <span class="yellow">mental health charity</span> can use the calendar to organise internal events, spaces and resources for their users.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>What technology?</h2>
<p>Toolkitty is built on a <span class="red">Peer-to-Peer (P2P)</span><sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2" aria-describedby="fn2">2</a></sup> network designed by <a href="https://p2panda.org/" target="_blank">p2panda</a>. This means the network data is stored on the phones of all the members. This makes it very secure and cheap to operate as it requires no external server. P2P incentivises resource sharing and cooperation. This suggests an alternate online model to using centralised servers which own and store your data. The app is <span class="yellow">Offline First</span><sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3" aria-describedby="fn3">3</a></sup>. Reducing Internet dependencies makes the app faster, more robust and usable anywhere in the world.</p>
<br>
<p>The functionality of the app has been inspired by models of <span class="blue">non-hierarchical</span><sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4" aria-describedby="fn4">4</a></sup> organising. Horizontal methods of organising in digital space are an effective way for groups to run a calendar and organise resources while minimising the workload of administrators.</p>
<br>
<h2>Notes on design</h2>
<p>Accessibility concerns have greatly informed the design process. The typeface in use accross most of the app is Atkinson Hyperlegible, designed for visually impaired readers. We've user tested Toolkitty on a diverse cross section of people to ensure that the app is as simple as possible for everyone to use. Further feedback will help shape future edits to the interface.</p>
<br>
<h2>Context + people</h2>
<p>Toolkitty is an offshoot project of <a href="https://p2panda.org/" target="_blank">p2panda</a>. P2panda received funding from Innovate UK to build this prototype of Toolkitty.

<br>
<p>The seeds of Toolkitty can be found in activites around a collaborative publication called <a href="https://blatt3000.de/" target="_blank">Blatt3000</a>  and a collective festival building platform called <a href="https://hoffnung3000.de/" target="_blank">Hoffnung3000</a>. Hoffnung3000 was used to make the groups own festivals in Berlin. Further adoptions/uses of the platform include a project with Documenta15 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220626090057/https://kalender.zukunftsdorf22.org/" target="_blank">zukunftsdorf22.org</a> in Kassel in 2022 and for the <a href="https://antiuniversity.org/" target="_blank">Antiuniversity Festivals</a> in the UK. The idea behind Hoffnung3000 was to represent the non-hierarchical nature of communities in the structure of the platform and this is now being realised with Toolkitty using P2P network architecture.</p>
